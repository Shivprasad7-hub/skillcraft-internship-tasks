SkillCraft Internship Projects

This repository is a collection of mini web projects developed as part of my SkillCraft Internship program, undertaken during my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering journey. Each project represents a practical implementation of core web technologies, problem-solving skills, and front-end logic building.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my applied learning, demonstrate project-building capability, and highlight how simple concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be transformed into fully functional applications.

Through these projects, I explored UI/UX design, JavaScript interactivity, responsive layouts, and logical structures â€” all of which are essential skills for a Computer Science Engineer stepping into the professional development world.
